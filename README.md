# Electron Build Tools

This repository contains helper/wrapper scripts to make building Electron easier.

## Installation

A handful of prerequisites, such as git, python, and npm, are
required for building Electron itself; these can be found in
[Platform Prerequisites][platform-prerequisites]. `npm` can be used
with `build-tools` itself as well, but we've configured it to run
with `yarn`, so we also recommend you [install it to your system](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

From here, you'll need a command-line prompt. On Mac and Linux, this will
be a terminal with a shell, e.g. bash or zsh. You can also use these on
Windows if you install them, or use built-in tools like Windows'
[Command Prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands#command-shell-overview).

Please note that `build-tools` (due to nested dependencies) might not work properly in powershell, please use `cmd` on Windows for optimum results.

```sh
# Install build-tools package globally:
npm i -g @electron/build-tools
```

## Getting the Code and Building Electron

You can run a new Electron build with this command:

```sh
# The 'Hello, World!' of build-tools: get and build `main`
# Choose the directory where Electron's source and build files will reside.
# You can specify any path you like; this command defaults to `$PWD/electron`.
# If you're going to use multiple branches, you may want something like:
# `--root=~/electron/branch` (e.g. `~/electron-gn/main`)
e init --root=~/electron --bootstrap testing
```

That command's going to run for awhile. While you're waiting, grab a
cup of hot caffeine and read about what your computer is doing:

### Concepts

Electron's build-tools command is named `e`. Like [nvm][nvm] and git,
you'll invoke `e` with commands and subcommands. See `e --help` or `e help <cmd>`
for many more details.

`e` also borrows another inspiration from nvm: having multiple configurations
that you can switch between so that one is the current, active configuration.
Many choices go into an Electron build:

* Which [Electron branch](https://github.com/electron/electron/branches)
  is used (e.g. `main`, `13-x-y`)
* Which [.gn config file][gn-configs] is imported (e.g.
  [testing](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/build/args/testing.gn) or
  [release](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/build/args/release.gn))
* Any compile-time options (e.g. Clang's [asan or tsan][sanitizers])

`e` holds all these variables together in a build configuration. You can
have multiple build configurations and manage them in a way similar to nvm:

| nvm                  | e                  | Description                                    |
|:---------------------|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| nvm ls               | e show configs     | Show the available configurations              |
| nvm current          | e show current     | Show which configuration is currently in use   |
| nvm use &lt;name&gt; | e use &lt;name&gt; | Change which configuration is currently in use |

Getting the source code is a lot more than cloning `electron/electron`.
Electron is built on top of Chromium (with Electron patches) and Node
(with more Electron patches). A source tree needs to have all of the
above **and** for their versions to be in sync with each other. Electron
uses Chromium's [Depot Tools][depot-tools] and [GN][gn] for wrangling
and building the code. `e` wraps these tools:

| Command | Description                                                    |
|:--------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| e init  | Create a new build config and initialize a GN directory        |
| e sync  | Get / update / synchronize source code branches                |
| e build | Build it!                                                      |

### e init

`e init` initializes a new local development environment for Electron.

To see all potential options for this command, run:

```sh
$ e init --help
```

New build configs are created with `e init`. It has several command-line
options to specify the build configuration, e.g. the path to the source
code, compile-time options, and so on. See `e init --help` for in-depth
details.

Each build config has a name, chosen by you to use as a mnemonic when
switching between build configs with `e use <name>`. This is the name's
only purpose, so choose whatever you find easiest to work with &mdash;
whether it's `electron`, `6-1-x--testing`, or `chocolate-onion-popsicle`.

Each build also needs a root directory. All the source code and built
files will be stored somewhere beneath it. `e init` uses `$PWD/electron`
by default, but you can choose your own with `--root=/some/path`. If you
want to make multiple build types of the same branch, you can reuse
an existing root to share it between build configs.

As an example, let's say you're starting from scratch and want both
testing and release builds of the main branch in `electron/electron`.
You might do this:

```sh
# making 'release' and 'testing' builds from main

$ e init main-testing -i testing --root=~/src/electron
Creating '~/src/electron'
New build config 'main-testing' created
Now using config 'main-testing'
$ e show current
main-testing

$ e init main-release -i release --root=~/src/electron
INFO Root '~/src/electron' already exists.
INFO (OK if you are sharing $root between multiple build configs)
New build config 'main-release' created
Now using config 'main-release'

$ e show configs
* main-release
  main-testing

$ e show current
main-release
$ e show root
~/src/electron

$ e use main-testing
Now using config 'main-testing'
$ e show current
main-testing
$ e show root
~/src/electron
```

As a convenience, `e init --bootstrap` will run `e sync` and `e build`
after creating the build config. Let's see what those do:

### `e sync`

To see all potential options for this command, run:

```sh
$ e sync --help
```

`e sync` is a wrapper around `gclient sync` from [Depot Tools][depot-tools].
If you're starting from scratch, this will (slowly) fetch all the source
code. It's also useful after switching Electron branches to synchronize
the rest of the sources to the versions needed by the new Electron branch.

`e sync` is usually all you need. Any extra args are passed along to gclient itself.

```sh
$ e show current
main-testing

$ e show root
~/src/electron

$ e sync
Running "gclient sync --with_branch_heads --with_tags" in '~/src/electron/src'
[sync output omitted]
```

To make your output more verbose, you can add an increasing number of `-v`s. For example,

```sh
# basic verbosity
$ e sync -v
Running "gclient sync --with_branch_heads --with_tags -v" in '~/src/electron/src'
[sync output omitted]

# significant verbosity
$ e sync -vvvv
Running "gclient sync --with_branch_heads --with_tags -vvvv" in '~/src/electron/src'
[sync output omitted]
```

### `e build`

`e build` builds an Electron executable.

To see all potential options for this command, run:

```sh
$ e build --help
```

Once you have the source, the next step is to build it with `e build [target]`.
These build targets are supported:

| Target        | Description                                              |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| breakpad      | Builds the breakpad `dump_syms` binary                   |
| chromedriver  | Builds the `chromedriver` binary                         |
| electron      | Builds the Electron binary **(Default)**                 |
| electron:dist | Builds the Electron binary and generates a dist zip file |
| mksnapshot    | Builds the `mksnapshot` binary                           |
| node:headers  | Builds the node headers `.tar.gz` file                   |

As with syncing, `e build [target]` is usually all you need. Any extra
args are passed along to [ninja][ninja], so for example `e build -v`
runs a verbose build.

## Using Electron

After you've built Electron, it's time to use it!

| Command | Description                          |
|:--------|:-------------------------------------|
| e start | Run the Electron build               |
| e node  | Run the Electron build as Node       |
| e debug | Run the Electron build in a debugger |
| e test  | Run Electron's spec runner           |

As usual, any extra args are passed along to the executable. For example,
`e node --version` will print out Electron's node version.

### `e debug`

`e debug` runs your local Electron build inside of [lldb][lldb] or [gdb][gdb].

```sh
$ uname
Linux
$ e debug
Reading symbols from /home/yourname/electron/gn/main/src/out/Testing/electron...
(gdb)
```

```sh
$ uname
Darwin

$ e debug
target create "/Users/yourname/electron-gn/src/out/Testing/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron"
(lldb)
```

### `e test`

`e test` starts the local Electron build's test runner. Any extra args are passed
along to the runner.

To see all potential options for this command, run:

```sh
$ e test --help
```

Example:

```sh
# run all tests
e test

# run main process tests
e test --runners=main
```

Possible extra arguments to pass:

* `--node` - Run Node.js' own tests with Electron in `RUN_AS_NODE` mode.
* `--runners=<main|native>` - The set of tests to run, can be either `main` or `native`.

### `e show`

`e show` shows information about the current build config.

To see all potential options for this command, run:

```sh
$ e show --help
```

| Command            | Description                                                    |
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| e show current     | The name of the active build config                            |
| e show configs     | Lists all build configs                                        |
| e show env         | Show environment variables injected by the active build config |
| e show exe         | The path of the built Electron executable                      |
| e show root        | The path of the root directory from `e init --root`.           |
| e show src \[name] | The path of the named (default: electron) source dir           |
| e show stats       | Build statistics                                               |

Example usage:

```sh
$ uname
Darwin

$ e show exe
/Users/username/electron-gn-root/src/out/Testing/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron

$ uname
Linux

$ e show exe
/home/username/electron-gn-root/src/out/Testing/electron

$ e show out
Testing

$ e show src
/home/username/electron-gn-root/src/electron

$ cd `e show src base` && pwd
/home/username/electron-gn-root/src/base

$ ripgrep --t h TakeHeapSnapshot `e show src`
```

### `e remove <name>`

`e remove|rm <name>` removes a build config from the list.

### `e open <commit | issue | PR>`

`e open` opens the GitHub page for the specified commit, pull request, or issue.

To see all potential options for this command, run:

```sh
$ e open --help
```

For example, `e open 0920d01` will find the commit with an abbreviated
sha1 of `0920d01`, see that it's associated with pull request #23450,
and open https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/23450 in your browser.
Since you can pass in a pull request or issue number as well,
`e open 23450` would have the same effect.

### `e patches [patch-dir]`

`e patches` exports patches to the specified patch directory in Electron source tree.

To see all potential options for this command, run:

```sh
$ e patches --help
```

Valid patch directories can include:

* `node`
* `v8`
* `boringssl`
* `chromium`
* `perfetto`
* `icu`

| Command              | Source Directory                   | Patch Directory                   |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| e patches node       | `src/third_party/electron_node`    | `src/electron/patches/node`       |
| e patches chromium   | `src`                              | `src/electron/patches/chromium`   |
| e patches boringssl  | `src/third_party/boringssl/src`    | `src/electron/patches/boringssl`  |
| e patches v8         | `src/v8`                           | `src/electron/patches/v8`         |
| e patches perfetto   | `src/third_party/perfetto`         | `src/electron/patches/perfetto`   |
| e patches icu        | `src/third_party/icu`              | `src/electron/patches/icu`        |

### `e sanitize-config <name>`

`e sanitize-config` updates and/or overwrites an existing config to conform to latest `build-tools` updates.

To see all potential options for this command, run:

```sh
$ e sanitize-config --help
```

Sometimes `build-tools` will make updates to its config requirements. In these events warnings will be output to console to inform you that `build-tools` has temporarily handled the issues. You can make these warnings go away either by manually updating your config files or by running this command to automatically overwrite the existing configs to update formatting.

### `e shell`

`e shell` launches a shell environment populated with build-tools' environment variables and context.

Developers may for example find themselves wishing to access `gn` and `ninja` directly - instead of using `e d gn` to access that this command can be used. This also enables bash completion and the ability to copy-paste commands from Chromium docs without modification.

```sh
$ e shell
# Launching build-tools shell with "/bin/zsh"
# Running "/bin/zsh"
```

## Common Usage

### Building a Specific Electron Version

`e init` checks out the HEAD of the main branch. To build against a specific version of Electron, checkout that version with these commands:

```sh
# Change working directory to the Electron source directory
cd `e show src`

# Checkout the desired Electron version (in this case, 11.0.0)
git checkout tags/v11.0.0 -b v11.0.0

# Sync dependencies with the current branch
e sync

# Build Electron
e build
```

## Advanced Usage

### Per-Session Active Configs

If you want your shell sessions to each have different active configs, try this in your `~/.profile` or `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
export EVM_CURRENT_FILE="$(mktemp --tmpdir evm-current.XXXXXXXX.txt)"
```

This will create per-shell temporary files in which the active config file can be changed with `e use`.

### Disabling Automatic Updates

With the default configuration, build-tools will automatically check for updates every 4 hours.

You can enable and disable these automatic updates with the following commands:

```sh
$ e auto-update enable
$ e auto-update disable
```

Regardless of whether automatic updates are enabled, you can manually call the following command to immediately trigger an update.

```sh
$ e auto-update check
```
